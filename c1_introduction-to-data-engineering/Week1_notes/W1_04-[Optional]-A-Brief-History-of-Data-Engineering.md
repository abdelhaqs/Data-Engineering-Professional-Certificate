# 4.1 [Optional] A Brief History of Data Engineering

The text traces the evolution of data and data engineering from the 1960s to the present day:

## Key Milestones:
* 1960s: First computerized databases introduced
* 1970s: Relational databases and SQL emerge
* 1980s: First data warehouse developed
* 1990s: Business intelligence tools and data modeling approaches created
* Mid-1990s: Internet goes mainstream
* Early 2000s: Big data era begins

## Big Data Era Highlights:
* Characterized by three Vs: velocity, variety, and volume
* Google's MapReduce paper (2004) was a pivotal moment
* Apache Hadoop developed in 2006
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) created flexible cloud computing
* Transition from batch computing to event streaming

## Modern Data Engineering:
* "Big data" term has lost relevance
* Data engineering now focuses on interoperability
* Tools have become more accessible and sophisticated
* Data engineers now play a more strategic role in business
* Goal is to build scalable data systems and deliver business value

The narrative emphasizes how technological innovations have transformed data collection, storage, and analysis, making sophisticated data tools available to companies of all sizes and enabling data engineers to contribute directly to business strategies.

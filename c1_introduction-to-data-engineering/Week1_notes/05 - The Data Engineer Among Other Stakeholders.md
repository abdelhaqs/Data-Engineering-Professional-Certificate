## Data Engineering: Stakeholder Relationships and Value Creation

### Core Responsibilities:
* Transform raw data into useful formats for downstream use cases
* Understand and serve the needs of both upstream and downstream stakeholders

### Downstream Stakeholders:
* Includes analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, salespeople, product managers, marketing professionals, and executives
* Key considerations when serving these stakeholders:
  1. Query frequency and database refresh rates
  2. Information retrieval needs
  3. Data processing optimizations (e.g., pre-joining tables)
  4. Acceptable data latency
  5. Precise data definitions (e.g., time zone considerations)

### Upstream Stakeholders:
* Typically software engineers responsible for source systems
* May be internal or third-party developers
* Important to establish communication to understand:
  1. Data volume, frequency, and format
  2. Potential data flow disruptions
  3. Schema changes
  4. Data security and regulatory compliance

### Strategic Approach:
* Engage with the company's overall strategy
* Understand how data can extract business value
* Develop strong relationships with both upstream and downstream stakeholders
* Align data engineering efforts with organizational goals

The document emphasizes that successful data engineering is not just about technical skills, but also about communication, understanding stakeholder needs, and creating value through data transformation.

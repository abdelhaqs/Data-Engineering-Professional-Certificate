# 1 - Welcome to Data Engineering

This is an introduction to a Data Engineering course/specialization featuring instructor Joe Res, who is a data engineer, architect, and co-author of "Fundamentals of Data Engineering." The text highlights several key points:

## 1. Key Context:
* The digital transformation across industries has led to a massive increase in data
* This creates new challenges in data storage and processing
* There's growing demand for data engineers

## 2. About the Instructor:
* Joe Res is a "recovering data scientist" who transitioned to data engineering
* He noticed companies were hiring data scientists without proper data infrastructure
* He shifted to data engineering to help build better foundations for data science

## 3. Course Structure:
The specialization consists of 4 courses:
* Course 1: Big picture framework and Cloud data pipelines
* Course 2: Data ingestion, data ops, and pipeline orchestration
* Course 3: Cloud data storage
* Course 4: Data modeling, transformation, and serving

## 4. Prerequisites:
* Experience with data and Python
* SQL and Cloud tools experience helpful but not required

## 5. Target Audience:
* Aspiring data engineers
* Current data engineers looking to improve skills
* Professionals in adjacent fields (data science, ML, software engineering)

The course partners with AWS (Amazon Web Services) to provide hands-on practical exercises, reflecting the industry's move toward cloud-based data engineering.

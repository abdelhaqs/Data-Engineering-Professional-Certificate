# Thinking Like a Data Engineer

The document outlines a four-stage framework for how data engineers should approach projects:

## 1. Determine Business Goals and Stakeholder Needs
- Understand the high-level business objectives  
- Identify all relevant stakeholders
- Understand stakeholders' specific needs and the actions they plan to take with the data

## 2. Turn Needs into Requirements
- Define the functional requirements: what the system must be able to do
- Define the non-functional requirements: the technical specifications of how it will do it

## 3. Choose Tools and Technologies
- Evaluate trade-offs between different tool and technology options based on factors like cost, cloud resource usage, and maintainability
- Set up a prototype to test whether the proposed system design will deliver value to stakeholders

## 4. Build, Deploy, and Evolve
- Build and deploy the data system
- Continuously monitor and evolve the system over time to keep up with changing business goals and stakeholder needs

The document emphasizes that this process is not linear, but rather an ongoing, cyclical one where data engineers are constantly communicating with stakeholders, defining requirements, and updating their systems accordingly.

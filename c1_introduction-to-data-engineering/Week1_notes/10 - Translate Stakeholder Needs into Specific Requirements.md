# 10 Translate Stakeholder Needs into Specific Requirements

The text discusses key strategies for requirements gathering in data engineering, focusing on a conversation with a data scientist. The main elements of effective requirements gathering include:

## 1. Understanding Existing Systems and Pain Points:
* Learn about current data delivery methods
* Identify challenges in existing solutions
* In this case, the marketing team received only daily data dumps, which was suboptimal

## 2. Clarifying Stakeholder Actions:
* Ask what specific actions stakeholders plan to take with the data
* This is different from asking what they need
* In the example, actions included:
  * Making marketing campaign decisions
  * Generating product recommendations
  * Creating analytics dashboards

## 3. Important Considerations:
* Be precise about terms like "real-time"
* Understand the specific latency requirements
* Identify functional and non-functional system requirements

## 4. Identifying Additional Stakeholders:
* Recognize the need to talk to other teams (e.g., software engineering, marketing)
* Gather more detailed information about system needs and constraints

## 5. Confirmation and Iteration:
* Repeat back what you've learned to confirm understanding
* Be prepared to refine requirements through multiple conversations

The overall goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of data system requirements by engaging directly with stakeholders, asking precise questions, and iteratively clarifying needs.

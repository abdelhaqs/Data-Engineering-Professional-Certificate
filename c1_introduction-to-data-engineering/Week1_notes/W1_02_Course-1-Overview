# 2 Course 1 Overview

The document is an introduction to a data engineering course, presented from the perspective of an instructor who shares a personal experience transitioning from a data scientist to understanding data engineering.

## Key points:

### 1. Course Context:
* The course is set up as a scenario where the student has just been hired as a data engineer at a company in the commerce space
* The instructor describes a common scenario where data scientists are initially hired without proper data infrastructure

### 2. Course Structure:
* Week 1: High-level overview of data engineering
  * Focus on thinking like a data engineer
  * No coding or tool usage this week
  * Understanding the data engineering life cycle and stakeholder needs
* Week 2: Deep dive into data engineering life cycle stages
  * Theoretical orientation
  * Hands-on practice with AWS Cloud data pipelines
* Week 3: Principles of good data architecture
* Week 4: Designing and building a data architecture that delivers business value

### 3. Instructor's Philosophy:
* Emphasizes understanding the big picture before implementation
* Warns against diving into tools without understanding business requirements
* Stresses the importance of translating stakeholder needs into system requirements

### 4. Learning Approach:
* First week is about developing a mental framework for successful data systems
* Technical skills and tool usage will be covered in subsequent weeks
* Labs will use cutting-edge tools on AWS Cloud

The overall message is that successful data engineering requires a strategic, holistic approach that prioritizes understanding business needs over technical implementation.

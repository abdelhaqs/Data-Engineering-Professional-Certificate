# Data Engineering Specialization - Week 1 Overview

This document provides an overview of the first week of the data engineering specialization, which focuses on the high-level aspects of data engineering.

## Key Takeaways:

1. **Data Engineering Life Cycle and Fundamentals**: The course starts by covering the overall data engineering life cycle and important concepts like working with stakeholders and delivering value for the organization.

2. **Varied Data Engineering Toolsets**: The set of tools and technologies a data engineer works with can vary significantly from one company to another, depending on factors like the use of on-premises systems versus cloud-based infrastructure.

3. **Cloud-First Approach**: This specialization will take a cloud-first approach, focusing primarily on building data pipelines and architectures on the AWS cloud, as it is the most widely used public cloud platform.

4. **Just-in-Time Learning**: Instead of attempting to cover all aspects of AWS, the courses will introduce specific cloud tools and technologies as they are needed for the lab exercises.

5. **Importance of Cloud Computing Basics**: While no prior knowledge of cloud computing is required, having some familiarity with cloud computing basics and terminology will help provide context as you progress through the courses.

The document also introduces the upcoming guest speaker, Morgan Willis, a principal cloud technologist, who will join the instructor to discuss the AWS cloud and its resources.

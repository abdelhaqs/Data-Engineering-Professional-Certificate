# Introduction to AWS Core Services

This document provides an overview of the key AWS (Amazon Web Services) services that will be covered in the upcoming courses.

## Core AWS Service Categories

1. **Compute**:
   - The primary compute service is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which provides virtual machines (instances) that you can use to run your applications and workloads.
   - Other compute options include serverless functions with AWS Lambda and container hosting with services like Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

2. **Networking**:
   - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to create and manage your own private networks within the AWS cloud.
   - VPCs are region-specific and can be partitioned into subnets.

3. **Storage**:
   - Object storage: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for storing unstructured data like documents, logs, and media.
   - Block storage: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for attaching high-performance storage volumes to EC2 instances.
   - File storage: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for scalable file storage that can be accessed by multiple systems.

4. **Databases**:
   - Relational databases: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for managed cloud-based relational databases.
   - Data warehousing: Amazon Redshift for large-scale data warehousing and analytics.

5. **Security**:
   - AWS follows a shared responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, and you are responsible for the security of your resources and workloads within the cloud.

The document emphasizes that these core service categories provide a good starting point, but the full breadth of AWS services is much broader. Throughout the upcoming courses, you will have the opportunity to explore these core services in more depth through hands-on labs and exercises.

# Data Engineering Undercurrents

## Evolution of Data Engineering
- Field has matured significantly over the past decade
- Shifted from purely technical focus
- Moving up the value chain
- Tools becoming more abstracted and simplified

## Expanded Scope
- Beyond tools and technologies
- Incorporates traditional enterprise practices:
  - Data management
  - Cost optimization
- Includes modern practices:
  - DataOps
  - Advanced orchestration

## Core Undercurrents
Practices that apply across the entire data engineering lifecycle:

1. Security
2. Data Management
3. DataOps
4. Data Architecture
5. Orchestration
6. Software Engineering

## Significance
- These undercurrents affect all stages of the lifecycle:
  - Data ingestion
  - Transformation
  - Storage
  - Serving
- Critical for modern data engineering success

## Modern Context
- Integration with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS)
- Emphasis on comprehensive approach
- Balance of technical and management practices

## Key Takeaway
Modern data engineering requires understanding and implementing these undercurrents throughout the entire data lifecycle, moving beyond pure technical implementation to a more holistic approach.

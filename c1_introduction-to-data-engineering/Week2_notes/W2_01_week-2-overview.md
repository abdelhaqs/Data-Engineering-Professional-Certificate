# Week 2 Overview

In this second week of the data engineering specialization, the focus shifts to a deeper dive into the data engineering lifecycle and its underlying concepts.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Data Engineering Lifecycle**:
   - The lifecycle begins with data generation from source systems, which is the stage preceding the data engineer's work.
   - The data engineer's main responsibilities include:
     - Ingesting raw data
     - Transforming the data into something useful
     - Storing the data
     - Making the data available for downstream use cases like analytics and machine learning.

2. **Undercurrents of the Data Engineering Lifecycle**:
   - Security
   - Data management
   - DataOps
   - Data architecture
   - Orchestration
   - Software engineering

## Approach

- This week, similar to the previous week, focuses on building a high-level mental framework for data engineering, rather than directly building data infrastructure.
- The instructor believes it's crucial to establish this conceptual foundation before diving into the practical implementation aspects.

## Practical Application

- At the end of the week, the course will demonstrate how this mental framework translates to practical work on the AWS cloud.
- Students will have the opportunity to build their first end-to-end cloud data pipeline as a lab activity.

The key takeaway is that this week will provide a deeper understanding of the data engineering lifecycle and its underlying principles, setting the stage for the hands-on cloud-based work to come.

# Software Engineering for Data Engineers

## Historical Context
- Data engineering emerged from software engineering
- Initially, software engineers handled data tasks
- Field evolved due to growing data volume and diversity
- Emerged as separate discipline over time

## Modern Context
- Access to managed services and applications
- Less code writing than historical data engineering
- Focus shifted to higher-value activities
- Code quality more important than ever

## Core Requirements

### Programming Skills
- Must write production-grade code that is:
  - Clean
  - Readable
  - Testable
  - Deployable

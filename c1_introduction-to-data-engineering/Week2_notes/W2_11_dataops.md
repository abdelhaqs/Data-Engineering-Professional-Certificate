# DataOps Overview

## Origin and Background
- Emerged as data field's adaptation of DevOps principles
- Based on DevOps framework (established around 2007)
- Incorporates elements from lean and agile methodologies
- Aims to improve data product development and quality

## Core Cultural Elements
- Prioritizes communication and collaboration with stakeholders
- Emphasizes continuous learning from successes and failures
- Focuses on rapid iteration for system improvements
- Adopts agile methodology principles
- Delivers work in incremental steps

## Three Key Pillars

### 1. Automation
- Implements CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)
- Manages changes in:
  - Code
  - Configuration
  - Environment
  - Data processing pipelines
  - Data itself

#### Automation Approaches:
1. **Manual Execution**
   - Suitable for prototyping
   - Prone to errors
   - Inefficient for long-term use

2. **Pure Scheduling**
   - Tasks start at predetermined times
   - Based on estimated completion times
   - Limited dependency management

3. **Orchestration Frameworks (e.g., Airflow)**
   - Checks task dependencies
   - Automated task execution
   - Error notification system
   - Enables automatic verification
   - Supports pipeline deployment

### 2. Observability and Monitoring
- Essential due to inevitable system failures
- Prevents unexpected data issues
- Enables proactive problem detection
- Maintains stakeholder trust
- Critical for system reliability

### 3. Incident Response
- Focuses on rapid issue identification
- Emphasizes quick problem resolution
- Requires:
  - Effective tools and technology
  - Open communication
  - Blameless coordination
  - Team collaboration

## Implementation Notes
- DataOps is still evolving
- Adoption varies across organizations
- Critical for modern data architectures
- Requires proactive approach to issue detection
- Orchestration is a key component

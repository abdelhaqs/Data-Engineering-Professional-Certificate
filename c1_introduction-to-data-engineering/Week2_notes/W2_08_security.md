# Security in Data Engineering

## Core Concepts

### Personal Security Analogy
- Similar to protecting:
  - Bank account information
  - Online passwords
  - House keys
- Translates to protecting client and business data

## Key Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimal necessary access
- Time-limited permissions
- Applies to:
  - Users
  - Applications
  - Self-administration
- Avoid unnecessary admin/root access

### Data Sensitivity Management
1. Access Control
   - Limit visibility of sensitive information
   - Need-based access only

2. Data Ingestion Strategy
   - Only ingest necessary sensitive data
   - Eliminate unnecessary risk by not storing sensitive data

## Modern Security Considerations

### Cloud Security
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Encryption methods
- Networking protocols
- Proper configuration of cloud resources

### Common Security Issues
- Exposed AWS S3 buckets
- Unsecured databases
- Public server access
- Misconfigured permissions

## Human Factor in Security

### Individual Responsibility
- Defensive mindset
- Cautious credential handling
- Attack scenario awareness
- Pipeline design with security in mind

### Common Human-Related Breaches
- Password sharing
- Phishing attack vulnerability
- Irresponsible system usage
- Accidental exposures

## Organizational Security

### Security Culture
- Beyond compliance checklists
- Avoiding "security theater"
- Organization-wide understanding
- Shared responsibility model

### Best Practices
- Proactive security measures
- Regular security audits
- Employee training
- Continuous monitoring

## Key Takeaways
1. Security is everyone's responsibility
2. Technical solutions must be paired with human awareness
3. Prevention is better than reaction
4. Cultural adoption is crucial
5. Regular review and updates necessary

## Implementation Notes
- Security considerations affect all pipeline stages
- Regular security assessments needed
- Continuous learning about new threats
- Balance security with usability

# Data Architecture Overview

## Definition
Data architecture is the design of systems to support the evolving data needs of an enterprise, achieved through flexible and reversible decisions reached by careful evaluation of trade-offs.

## Key Characteristics
- Supports both current and future data needs
- Requires ongoing effort and evolution
- Relies on flexible and reversible decisions
- Involves careful trade-off evaluation (performance, cost, scalability)

## Core Principles

1. **Choose Common Components Wisely**
   - Select components that serve multiple teams
   - Facilitate collaboration while meeting individual project needs

2. **Plan for Failure**
   - Design systems that handle both normal operations and failures
   - Build in redundancy and recovery mechanisms

3. **Architect for Scalability**
   - Enable systems to scale up with demand
   - Allow scaling down to optimize costs
   - Respond to changing needs efficiently

4. **Architecture is Leadership**
   - Understand architectural principles to better lead and mentor
   - Develop skills that may lead to architect roles

5. **Always be Architecting**
   - Treat architecture as an ongoing process
   - Continuously evaluate against organizational needs
   - Adapt to evolving requirements

6. **Build Loosely Coupled Systems**
   - Create modular components
   - Enable easy component replacement
   - Minimize system-wide impacts of changes

7. **Make Reversible Decisions**
   - Choose solutions that can be modified later
   - Maintain flexibility in system design
   - Allow for easy component swapping

8. **Prioritize Security**
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Follow zero trust principles
   - Make security central to engineering decisions

9. **Embrace FinOps**
   - Align business priorities with technical operations
   - Optimize for cost and revenue generation
   - Leverage pay-as-you-go cloud capabilities

## Modern Context
- Cloud-based architectures offer more flexibility than traditional on-premises systems
- Easier to make and reverse decisions in cloud environments
- Pay-as-you-go model enables better cost optimization

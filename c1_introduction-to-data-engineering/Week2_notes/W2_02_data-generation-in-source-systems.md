# Data Generation and Source Systems

The first stage of the data engineering lifecycle is the generation of data and source systems. As a data engineer, you'll be consuming data from various sources, such as:

1. **Databases**: Both relational databases (tables of related data) and NoSQL systems (key-value, document stores, etc.). These databases may be part of web/mobile applications or used for storing data from other systems.

2. **Files**: Text files, audio, video, and other file formats that need to be accessed and processed.

3. **APIs**: Applications Programming Interfaces that allow you to request and receive data in structured formats like XML or JSON.

4. **Data Sharing Platforms**: Platforms set up by organizations to share data internally or with third parties.

5. **IoT Devices**: "Internet of Things" devices that stream real-time data, often to a database that needs to be integrated.

While the data from these source systems may be crucial for your downstream workflows, they are often unpredictable and outside of your direct control as a data engineer. Some key points about working with source systems:

- In an ideal world, source systems would deliver consistent, timely data. In reality, they can be unreliable - going down, changing data formats, or making other unexpected changes.

- It's important to understand how each source system is set up, how the data is generated, and what changes to expect over time. This helps you anticipate and plan for issues.

- Building strong working relationships with the owners/stakeholders of source systems is crucial. This allows you to stay informed about changes and collaborate effectively.

- The "ingestion" phase of the data engineering lifecycle, where you pull data from sources, can vary greatly depending on the source systems you're working with.

The key is to develop a deep understanding of your source systems and establish clear communication channels with the teams managing them. This will help you build resilient and adaptable data pipelines.

# Data Storage Systems Overview

## Daily Interactions with Storage
- Personal devices use various storage types:
  - Hard disk/SSD for file storage
  - RAM for application loading
  - Cloud storage for backups
  - Mobile device storage
  - Internet-based storage systems

## Storage Hardware Components

### Physical Storage Types
1. Magnetic Disks
   - Still backbone of modern storage
   - 2-3x cheaper than solid state storage
   - Widely used in data centers

2. Solid State Storage
   - Flash memory cards
   - Solid State Drives (SSD)
   - Faster than magnetic disks but more expensive

3. RAM (Memory)
   - 30-50x more expensive than solid state storage
   - Much faster read/write speeds
   - Volatile (data lost when power is cut)

## Storage Hierarchy

### 1. Raw Ingredients
- Physical components (disk, RAM, SSD)
- Non-physical elements:
  - Networking
  - CPU
  - Serialization
  - Compression
  - Caching

### 2. Storage Systems
- Database management systems
- Object storage (e.g., Amazon S3)
- Apache Iceberg
- Hoody
- Cache-based storage
- Streaming storage

### 3. Storage Abstractions
- Data warehouse
- Data lake
- Data lakehouse
- Configuration-based systems for managing:
  - Latency
  - Scalability
  - Cost

## Best Practices for Data Engineers
- Understanding all storage hierarchy levels is crucial
- Common pitfalls include:
  - Overlooking system limitations
  - Poor performance choices
  - Cost inefficiencies
- Example: Row-by-row vs. bulk data ingestion impact
- Focus on being "storage savvy" for optimal system design

## Key Takeaway
While data engineers may primarily work with high-level storage abstractions, understanding the underlying components and systems is essential for building efficient, cost-effective solutions.

# Data Transformation in Data Engineering

## Overview
Data transformation is where data engineers create value by converting raw data into useful formats for downstream stakeholders.

## Core Components
The transformation stage consists of three key parts:
1. Queries
2. Modeling
3. Transformation

## Queries

### Key Points
- Used to request records from databases/storage systems
- Primarily uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Can involve:
  - Cleaning data
  - Joining datasets
  - Aggregating data
  - Filtering records

### Risks of Poor Queries
- Performance impact on source databases
- Row explosion from improper joins
- Infrastructure strain
- Downstream delays in reporting/analytics

## Data Modeling

### Purpose
- Represents how data relates to real-world scenarios
- Creates coherent structure for business use
- Aligns data with organization's processes and logic

### Example Applications
- Converting normalized data to denormalized format
- Structuring data for efficient analyst queries
- Adapting to different departmental definitions
- Supporting business-specific workflows

## Data Transformation

### Transformation Points
1. Pre-ingestion
   - Example: Adding timestamps at source

2. During ingestion ("in flight")
   - Data type mapping
   - Format standardization

3. Post-ingestion
   - Schema transformations
   - Denormalization
   - Aggregation for reporting
   - Feature engineering for ML

## Use Cases Examples

### Business Analysts
- Need formatted data for:
  - Daily sales reports
  - Product analysis
  - Customer insights
  - Time-based metrics

### Data Scientists
- Require transformed data for:
  - Predictive analytics
  - Model training
  - Feature engineering
  - Analysis

## Best Practices
- Understand stakeholder terminology
- Align with business goals
- Consider downstream use cases
- Plan for multiple transformation stages
- Ensure efficient query design

## Key Takeaway
Successful transformation requires understanding both technical aspects (queries, modeling) and business needs to create valuable, usable data products.
